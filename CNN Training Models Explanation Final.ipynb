    "**Optimization Strategy:**\n",
    "- **Transfer Learning**: Pre-trained ImageNet weights used for MobileNet, VGG16, ResNet, ResNet50\n",
    "- **Frozen Base**: Base model weights frozen, only classifier/top layers trainable\n",
    "- **Learning Rate**: 0.0001 for most models (0.001 for ResNet and ZFNet standalone)\n",
    "- **Learning Rate Scheduling**: ReduceLROnPlateau callback reduces LR by factor of 0.5 when validation loss plateaus\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regularization:**\n",
    "- Data augmentation provides strong regularization (evident from validation > training accuracy in many models)\n",
    "- Early stopping prevents overfitting\n",
    "- Learning rate reduction helps fine-tuning\n",
